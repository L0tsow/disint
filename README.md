# DisInt
Use of DisInt ?

    DisInt is an in-house tool for Osint
    You can simply by entering the discord id find a lot of information about an account,
    like his avatar, banner link to search by image. You can also get more information.

What mean DisInt ?

    DisInt is the contraction of "Discord" and "Osint"

Usage & setup

    $ git clone https://github.com/l0tsow/disint
    $ cd disint/
    $ python3 main.py
    
    on line 7, to the value "token".
    in the "" after the =, you must enter the token of a discord account that will be able to make 
    requests. I advise you to create a useless account and use its token to make requests with the API
